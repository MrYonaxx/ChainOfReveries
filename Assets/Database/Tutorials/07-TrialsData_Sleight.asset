  textboxStart:
  - Sleights are special attacks using a combination of 3 cards.
  - The value of the 3 cards you combine is added, which means that you can play
    an action with a value above 9.
  - The action your character performs is dependant of the 3 cards you stocked.
  - For example, if you combine 3 Fire cards you will do a stronger fireball.
  textboxEnd:
  - Be careful, while Sleights are strong, they have a huge weakness.
  - You lose the first card of the Sleight for the rest of the battle.
  - Each character has his own set of Sleights that you will need to learn in order
    to master your character.
  - But you don't need to use all the Sleights your character possess in every battle.
  - Focus on a few Sleights per run and create a deck around them.
  comboNotes:
  - Stock 3 cards
  - 'Sleight : Evening Breeze'
  - 'Sleight : Fire EX'
