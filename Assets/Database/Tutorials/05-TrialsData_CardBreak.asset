  textboxStart:
  - The Card Break is the core mechanic of the game, so listen well.
  - Each card has a value from 0 to 9.
  - When a card is played, the card is placed to the center of the screen during
    the action.
  - If the opponent play a card with a value superior than the current card value,
    a Card Break occurs.
  - Being Card Breaked cancel your attack and put you in a stun state.
  - Now try to Card Break your opponent.
  textboxEnd:
  - Knowing how to Card Break a opponent can prevent him from even attacking during
    a battle.
  - But be careful, as you too, will not be able to put a fight if you can't Card
    Break the opponent cards.
  - Note that some cards have special Card Break rules.
  - And don't forget that you're not forced to always Card Break a action, you can
    simply evade the attack.
